# Product Recommendation System for E-commerce Project

## Project Background
This project improves product recommendations and tracks market trends for an online store. A **SQL**-based data warehouse was set up to store customer and sales data. The project analyzed **10,000** customer records, predicted sales trends, and created personalized recommendations using **Python** to enhance user experience. These insights help businesses find profitable areas and improve marketing, leading to growth and happier customers.

## Dataset Structure 
The dataset for this project was organized into a SQL-based data warehouse with multiple tables for customer data, sales records, product information, and regional market data. The primary data structure used for this analysis and modeling is the combination of two major sources:

  * [Superstore Data](https://github.com/Mamta013/Product-Recommendation-System/blob/main/data/Superstore-Data.csv): Superstore purchase history and revenue data.
  * [Superstore Reviews Data](https://github.com/Mamta013/Product-Recommendation-System/blob/main/data/Superstore-Dataset-Reviews.csv): Rating, review and summary of the product given by the customer. 
    
Note: The dataset comprised 10,000+ records, divided into 36 columns, the feature-target description you can see [here](https://github.com/Mamta013/Product-Recommendation-System/blob/main/data/Features_Target_Description.txt).


## Executive Summary
This project built a **SQL**-based Superstore Data Warehouse and developed product recommendation models to enhance customer experience and sales strategies. By analyzing data from **10,000** customers, the system identified profitable market segments, predicted sales trends, and provided personalized product recommendations.  

Key insights included the **Consumer** segment being the most profitable, **California** as the top-performing market, and strategies to improve underperforming regions like **North Dakota**.
